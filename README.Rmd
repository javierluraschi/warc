This package provides a `read_warc()` function to read WARC files. This allows to read files
from the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) project.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("javierluraschi/warc")
```

## Intro

A sample WARC file is included in this package, it's path can be retrieved with:

```{r}
warc_file <- system.file("samples/sample.warc.gz", package = "warc")
```

Read a warc file with:

```{r}
warc::read_warc(warc_file)
```

As part of reading a WARC file, a filter can be applied over each WARC entry or over
each line. For instance, to retrieve all links referenced under an `<a` tag we can run:

```{r}
lines_with_links <- warc::read_warc(warc_file, line_filter = "<a href")
gsub(".*href=\"([^\"]*)\".*|(.*)", "\\1", lines_with_links$content)
```
